In this tutorial, we would like to introduce Angular 2 to Blaze developers.

We will start with a brief about Angular 2 and it's architecture and then we could get a better understanding about the similarities and differences between this two platforms.

We will also show how to run Blaze application with Angular 2, and how to migrate step-by-step each component.

## Reasons to migrate

- Blaze no longer maintained and developed (Since [Meteor 1.2](https://forums.meteor.com/t/next-steps-on-blaze-and-the-view-layer/13561)).
- Angular 2 provides more than UI templating and utils - you also get better architecture of the project.
- Angular 2 support a lot of features that missing in Blaze and you need to get from external packages (such as routing, i18n).
- Angular 2 supports [server side rendering](https://universal.angular.io/).

## What you need to know?

In this tutorial, we will migrate from ES2016 to TypeScript which has a better experience when developing Angular 2 application, so we recommend to go through [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html).

We also recommend to start this tutorial after a you wen't through the Angular 2 [tutorial and documentation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/).
